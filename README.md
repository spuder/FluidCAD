## Download

FluidCAD ships as a desktop app for Windows, Linux and macOS. Every build is on the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/Fluid-CAD/FluidCAD/releases/latest); the app then updates itself from there in the background.

| Platform | Download | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Windows** (x64) | `FluidCAD-<version>-win-x64.exe` | Not code-signed yet: SmartScreen shows *Windows protected your PC* on first launch. Choose **More info → Run anyway**. |
| **Linux** (x64) | `FluidCAD-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` or `FluidCAD-<version>-linux-amd64.deb` | AppImage: `chmod +x` and run. Deb: `sudo apt install ./FluidCAD-*.deb`. |
| **macOS** (Apple Silicon) | `FluidCAD-<version>-mac-arm64.dmg` or `.zip` | Signed and notarized; drag into **Applications**. |

Prefer a terminal and your own browser? FluidCAD is also an npm package -- see [Getting Started](#getting-started) below.

---

## Under the Hood

FluidCAD is built on [OpenCascade](https://dev.opencascade.org/), a full B-Rep (boundary representation) modeling kernel, through the [opencascade.js](https://ocjs.org/) WebAssembly binding. This means precise, production-grade geometry -- exact edges, fillets, and booleans -- not mesh approximations.

A huge thanks to the [opencascade.js](https://ocjs.org/) team for making this possible.

---

## Features

### Code-Driven 3D Modeling

Design parametric 3D models using JavaScript. Every change in your code is reflected instantly in the 3D viewport.

```js
import { extrude, fillet, sketch, circle } from 'fluidcad/core';

sketch("xy", () => {
    circle(50)
})

const e = extrude(50)

fillet(5, e.startEdges())
```

### Model with the Mouse

Prefer clicking? Pick geometry in the viewport, fill in a dialog, and FluidCAD writes the statement into your file -- sketches, extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, shell, fillet, chamfer, repeat, booleans and more. Double-click a timeline row to reopen the same dialog and edit that feature in place.

It's a companion to the code, not a replacement: everything it produces is ordinary FluidCAD code you can keep editing by hand.
<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://fluidcad.io/img/region-extrude.gif" alt="FluidCAD Region Extrude" />
</p>

### Constraint-Driven Sketches

Sketches work the way they do in mainstream CAD: the geometry you draw is a rough guess, and constraints state what must be true. A solver moves the geometry until every relationship holds, re-solving live while you drag. Fourteen constraints -- coincident, horizontal, vertical, parallel, perpendicular, tangent, equal, concentric, collinear, midpoint, symmetric, fix, dimension, angle -- each with a toolbar button, a keyboard shortcut and a badge in the viewport. The status pill tells you when the sketch is fully constrained.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://fluidcad.io/img/readme/sketch-solver.png" alt="A connecting-rod profile in sketch mode with its constraint code on the left, dimensions and constraint badges in the viewport, and the status pill reading Fully constrained" />
</p>

```js
import { sketch, line } from 'fluidcad/core';
import { coincident, horizontal, vertical, fix, distance } from 'fluidcad/constraints';

sketch("xy", () => {
    // Rough guesses -- the constraints do the work.
    const b = line([1, -2], [99, 3]);
    const r = line([99, 3], [101, 52]);
    const t = line([101, 52], [-2, 48]);
    const l = line([-2, 48], [1, -2]);
    coincident(b.end(), r.start());
    coincident(r.end(), t.start());
    coincident(t.end(), l.start());
    coincident(l.end(), b.start());
    horizontal(b);
    vertical(r);
    horizontal(t);
    vertical(l);
    fix(b.start(), [0, 0]);
    distance(b.start(), b.end(), 100);
    distance(r.start(), r.end(), 50);
})
```

Drawing tools infer constraints as you go (snapping onto a vertex writes `coincident`, a near-horizontal line writes `horizontal`), and the Rectangle, Polygon and Slot tools write their shape's constraints along with the lines and arcs, so every side stays editable afterwards. Projected edges from existing solids become fixed reference geometry you can constrain against.

### Assemblies

An `.assembly.js` file inserts parts, grounds one of them and joins the rest with mates. The viewport solves the mates live: drag a part and the mechanism moves within the freedom its joints leave.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://fluidcad.io/img/readme/engine-workspace.png" alt="A four-cylinder crank assembly open in the FluidCAD workspace: parts, connectors and joints on the left, the solved mechanism in the viewport" />
</p>

```js
import { assembly, insert, mate } from 'fluidcad/core';
import { plate } from './plate.part.js';
import { lever } from './lever.part.js';
import { pin } from './pin.part.js';

export const leverAssembly = assembly('lever-assembly', () => {
    const base = insert(plate).grounded();
    const arm = insert(lever);
    const pivotPin = insert(pin);

    // A hinge: the lever swings about the plate's bore, 30° at rest, ±45° of travel.
    mate('revolute', base.connectors.bore, arm.connectors.pivot).rotate(30).limits(-45, 45);
    // The pin rides along with the lever.
    mate('fastened', arm.connectors.pinSeat, pivotPin.connectors.head);
});
```

- **Six mate types**: fastened, revolute, slider, cylindrical, planar and tangent, with flip, rotate, offset and limits.
- **Connectors** are the mating frames: hover a face or edge on a part and the Connector tool writes `connector('name', …)`; assemblies can add free frames of their own.
- **Sub-assemblies** are `assembly()` definitions you insert like parts; `replicate()` stamps a mated sub-assembly onto more targets (the engine above is one piston sub-assembly and three replicas).
- **Parametric parts**: `param()` declares a value with a control in the Parameters panel, and `insert(part, { Width: 120 })` overrides it per instance.
- **Animate** a revolute or slider joint from its row in the Joints panel, and **export the whole assembly** as STEP (tree preserved) or STL.

### Modeling History

Navigate through your modeling history step by step. Review how any model was built and roll back to any point in the feature tree.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://fluidcad.io/img/history.gif" alt="FluidCAD History" />
</p>

### Feature Transforms

Re-apply modeling features based on matrix transformations. Move, rotate, or mirror entire feature sequences to build complex geometry from simple building blocks.

```javascript
sketch("xy", () => {
    rect(200, 100).centered()
})

const e1 = extrude(20)

sketch(e1.endFaces(), () => {
    circle([-80, 30], 30)
});

const pin = extrude(10)

const f = chamfer(2, pin.endEdges());

repeat("linear", ["x", "y"], {
    count: [4, 2],
    length: [160, -60]
}, pin, f)

```
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://fluidcad.io/img/repeat.png" alt="FluidCAD Repeat Feature" />
</p>


### Pattern Copying

Duplicate features in linear, circular or mirror patterns to quickly populate repetitive geometry -- `repeat()` re-applies a feature so it interacts with the solid at each new spot, `copy()` produces independent solids.

### Smart Defaults

Most operations just do the right thing without extra arguments. `extrude` picks up the last sketch, `fillet` targets the last selection, and touching shapes are automatically fused -- less boilerplate, more readable code.

### Selection Filters That Survive Edits

Picking faces and edges in the viewport writes a filter expression, not a list of indices: `face().planar().onPlane('xy', 10)`, `e.endEdges()`, `r.instance(1).endEdges()`. Filters compose by plane, shape, rank (largest, nearest, nth), convexity and feature of origin, so a fillet keeps finding its edges after the model above it changes.

### STEP Import / Export

Import and export STEP files with full color support. Bring in existing CAD models or share your designs with any standard CAD tool. Assemblies export as a STEP tree, one product per part and one component per instance.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://fluidcad.io/img/step-import.png" alt="FluidCAD Step Import" />
</p>

### Use Your Favorite Editor

The desktop app and `npx fluidcad serve` both come with a built-in code editor. FluidCAD also ships official extensions for **VS Code** and **Neovim**, and works with any editor -- just point the CLI at your project.

### LLM / AI Agent Integration (MCP)

FluidCAD ships an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server so AI agents (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, opencode, etc.) can drive a running workspace -- take screenshots, inspect geometry, edit model files, and look up the API by symbol. See [Set Up the MCP Server](#4-optional-set-up-the-mcp-server) below.

## Getting Started

The quickest route is the [desktop app](#download): install it, open a folder, and start modeling. The steps below are for running FluidCAD from a Node.js project in your browser.

### 1. Create a New Project

```bash
mkdir my-app && cd my-app
npm init -y
npm install fluidcad
npx fluidcad init
```

This generates `init.js`, `jsconfig.json`, a `fluidcad.json` project configuration and a starter `box.part.js`.

### File extensions

FluidCAD recognizes two kinds of source file:

- `*.part.js` — a **part** file. Code defines geometry; every edit
  rebuilds the model and updates the viewport.
- `*.assembly.js` — an **assembly** file. Code inserts parts and
  declares mates between them; the viewport solves the mechanism and lets you
  drag it.

`*.fluid.js` is also recognized as a part file.

### 2. Open It

```bash
npx fluidcad serve
```

That's the whole product in a browser tab: the 3D viewport, a code editor with
completion driven by the engine's own type declarations, and a live rebuild on
every change. Nothing else to install.

**Options:**

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-w, --workspace <path>` | Path to your project | Current directory |
| `-p, --port <port>` | Server port -- if it's taken, the next free one is used | `3100` |
| `--no-open` | Don't launch a browser -- for CI and remote sessions | _opens by default_ |

The code editor is hidden until you want it: open it from the left rail or with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>, and it takes width from the left rather than
covering the model.

The page uses relative URLs only, so `serve` also works behind a reverse proxy
that mounts it under a path (`/cad/` → `/`). Load it with the trailing slash.

<details>
<summary><strong>Many projects on a server (<code>fluidcad hub</code>)</strong></summary>

```bash
npx fluidcad hub --projects ~/cad --port 3100
```

Serves the desktop app's start screen at `/` for every subfolder of
`--projects` that holds an `init.js`. Opening one starts its own engine on
demand (a `fluidcad serve` bound to loopback) and proxies it at `/p/<name>/`,
WebSocket included; **New Project** runs `fluidcad init` in a new subfolder,
**Rename project…** renames its folder, and **Delete project…** moves its
folder to `<projects>/.trash/` (both on a card's menu). Inside a project, the
FluidCAD logo returns to the picker, saving any unsaved files first.

Several devices can have the same project open. A file saved on one reloads
on the others; one with unsaved edits there gets a warning instead, and
saving it asks whether to overwrite the newer version or load it. Unsaved
edits are also saved when the page is hidden or closed, since mobile Safari
gives no chance to ask. The 3D view is one scene per project, so switching
files on one device switches it on the others.

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--projects <dir>` | Folder whose subfolders are projects | Current directory |
| `-p, --port <port>` | Port the hub listens on | `3100` |
| `--idle-minutes <n>` | Stop an engine with no open page after this long (`0` = never) | `30` |

Like `serve`, the hub binds `127.0.0.1` by default and has no authentication.
Set `FLUIDCAD_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0` to expose it (e.g. in a container behind a
reverse proxy or a private network such as Tailscale); the per-project engines
stay on loopback either way.

A container image only needs the package and one port:

```dockerfile
FROM node:22-bookworm-slim
WORKDIR /opt/fluidcad
# A local install, so each project's `import 'fluidcad'` resolves by walking up.
RUN npm init -y >/dev/null && npm install --omit=dev fluidcad \
  && mkdir projects && chown node:node projects
ENV PATH=/opt/fluidcad/node_modules/.bin:$PATH FLUIDCAD_SERVER_HOST=0.0.0.0
USER node
EXPOSE 3100
CMD ["fluidcad", "hub", "--projects", "/opt/fluidcad/projects", "--port", "3100"]
```

Mount your projects at `/opt/fluidcad/projects` and put any HTTP(S) proxy in
front of port 3100 (Caddy, Traefik, nginx, Tailscale Serve, docktail
labels such as `docktail.service.port=3100`). The proxy must pass WebSocket
upgrades through.

</details>

### 3. Or Use Your Own Editor

Prefer to model with your own editor open beside the viewport? Both extensions
drive the same server.

<details>
<summary><strong>VS Code</strong></summary>

1. Install the **FluidCAD** extension from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FluidCAD.fluidcad).
2. Open your project folder in VS Code.
3. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`) and run **Show FluidCAD Scene**.

The 3D viewport opens in a side panel and updates live as you edit `.part.js` and `.assembly.js` files.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Neovim</strong></summary>

Add the plugin with [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim):

```lua
{
  "Fluid-CAD/FluidCAD",
  config = function()
    require("fluidcad").setup()
  end,
  ft = { "javascript" },
}
```

Open a `.part.js` file and the server starts automatically. Run `:FluidCadOpenBrowser` to open the 3D viewport in your browser.

See the full list of commands in the [Neovim plugin README](extension/neovim/README.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Any Other Editor</strong></summary>

`npx fluidcad serve` (above) works alongside any editor: keep the browser tab
open on the viewport and edit your model files in your own editor -- the model
rebuilds on save.

</details>

### 4. (Optional) Set Up the MCP Server

FluidCAD bundles an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server so LLM agents can drive your workspace -- screenshots, geometry inspection, source edits, API lookup. It's included in the `fluidcad` package; no separate install needed.

Wire it into your MCP client:

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

Register at user scope so it's available in every project:

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user FluidCAD -- npx -y fluidcad mcp
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Desktop / Cursor</strong></summary>

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json` or `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "FluidCAD": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "fluidcad", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>opencode</strong></summary>

Run `opencode mcp add` and answer the prompts, or add to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "mcp": {
    "FluidCAD": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["npx", "-y", "fluidcad", "mcp"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

Then install the companion skill so agents follow the FluidCAD workflow:

```bash
npx skills add Fluid-CAD/FluidCAD
```

See the [MCP README](mcp/README.md) for the full tool surface, transport details, and local-testing guide.

### 5. (Optional) Export from the Command Line

Turn a model into a STEP, STL, or PNG without leaving the terminal:

```bash
npx fluidcad export step                     # every shape -> <entry>.step
npx fluidcad export stl --resolution fine
npx fluidcad export png --view front --open
```

If a FluidCAD server is already running for the project (started by `serve` or an editor extension), the CLI exports the scene that server is showing. Otherwise it starts one, renders your model, exports, and shuts it down again.

**Options (all three formats):**

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `-w, --workspace <path>` | Path to your project | Current directory |
| `-e, --entry <file>` | Which model file to render | The workspace's only one |
| `-o, --out <path>` | Output file | `<entry>.<ext>` in the current directory |
| `-p, --port <port>` | Export from the running server on this port | Auto-discovered |
| `--timeout <sec>` | Seconds to wait for the server (and, for `png`, for a browser) | `60` |

`step` and `stl` add `--shapes` (a subset, by position, feature name, or id) and `--list-shapes`; on a `*.assembly.js` entry they write the whole assembly by default (STEP keeps the assembly tree, STL flattens it). `step` adds `--no-colors`. `stl` adds `--resolution coarse|medium|fine|custom` plus `--linear-deflection <mm>` / `--angular-deflection <deg>`. `png` adds `--view`, `--width`, `--height`, `--transparent`, `--show-axes`, `--no-grid`, `--no-auto-crop`, `--no-fit`, `--margin`, and `--open`.

> **PNG needs a browser.** Screenshots are rendered by the FluidCAD viewport itself, so a browser has to be connected to the server. Pass `--open` and the CLI launches one for you.

Run `npx fluidcad export step --help` (or `stl` / `png`) for the full flag reference.
