/**
 * The Part tool: a one-shot button that appends an empty
 * `part('Part N', () => {})` statement to the current file. No arming and no
 * panel — the render that follows carries the new part, and the caller
 * activates it so subsequent statements land inside its callback body.
 *
 * It owns a group of its own, registered between the history group and the
 * create group so the bar reads `Undo Redo | Part | Sketch Extrude …`: a part
 * is the container every modelling tool fills, so it comes before them and is
 * fenced off from both neighbours by a divider. The group needs no solid to be
 * useful, so it starts visible — an empty file still offers the Part button.
