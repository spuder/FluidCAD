 * explode faces at build time; shell and sketch pick faces only); picks
 * accumulate as a highlighted selection; right-click offers the multi-select
 * menu (tangent chain — a `.withTangents()` selector —, classified bucket,
 * same-type / equal-measure edges, occluded picks); the expression
 * row shows the synthesized code before Apply and is editable, with verified
 * alternatives in a dropdown; hovering shows the teach-mode attribution
 * tooltip. Apply asks the server to write the feature call into the source
 * file — the re-render is the preview and editor undo is the rollback.
 *
 * Sketch deviates deliberately: it runs a DIALOG (the same PanelShell
 * design as the create dialogs) with a single face/plane slot and no Apply —
 * picking IS the action. The first pick (a face, one of the origin planes
 * xy/xz/yz shown as viewport targets, or a `plane(…)` feature quad via the
 * viewer's opt-in `pickPlanes` channel) writes the sketch statement —
 * `sketch(<selector> | '<plane>' | <planeVar>, () => {})` — and the incoming
 * render enters the sketch; a face already highlighted on entry (or a plane
 * quad picked in neutral mode) is consumed as that pick. The dialog then
 * stays docked for the whole session of the sketch it started, its chip
 * showing the target. The chip's ✕ *suspends* sketch editing (free 3D
 * camera, grid restored, sketch UI released via the hooks) and re-arms the
 * pick — the next pick MOVES the statement's target argument in place (the
 * body survives); Escape cancels the re-pick back into the sketch view. The
 * session closes when the scene stops ending in the sketch (consumed by a
 * feature, deleted, rolled back), when another dialog takes over, or via the
 * Sketch button / Escape; when the dialog wrote the sketch itself, its Cancel
 * button goes further and deletes that statement from the code outright.
 * The dialog is scene-derived like
 * the rest of sketch mode: a render whose scene ends in a sketch with no
 * session ADOPTS it (page reloads, sketches entered by editing code, and the
 * timeline double-click that breakpoints a sketch row — sketch has no edit
 * dialog of its own), with
 * the chip label parsed from the statement's target argument — except a
 * sketch whose dialog the user dismissed, which stays closed. An adopted
 * sketch is one the dialog did not write, so closing it leaves the statement
 * alone; the double-click's breakpoint goes with the dialog. The button lives in the create group and is always
 * offered — in an empty scene the planes are the only targets, and the first
 * sketch starts here; while an extrude/sweep/loft dialog is up the button
 * disables instead of hiding.
